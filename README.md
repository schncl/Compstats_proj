# Bayesian Neural Networks via MCMC: A Python-Based Tutorial

This repository explores **Bayesian Linear Models (BLMs)** and **Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)**, focusing on their performance under different dataset sizes and conditions. It includes critical analyses, results from simulations, and Python-based implementation tutorials for **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** methods.

## Overview

This repository provides a **Python-based tutorial** on Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) using **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling**. The project explores the challenges of MCMC in large models and compares BNNs with Bayesian Linear Models (BLMs) on different datasets.

## Goals
- 🧠 Provide a practical introduction to **Bayesian Neural Networks** and **MCMC sampling**.
- 📊 Investigate the **computational challenges** and **convergence diagnostics**.
- ⚖️ Compare the **performance of BNNs and BLMs** on real datasets.

## Key Results
- ✅ **BNNs offer greater flexibility** in high-dimensional tasks but come at a higher computational cost.
- ⚡ **BLMs perform better on small datasets**, showing faster convergence and higher efficiency.
- ❌ **BNNs struggle with posterior multimodality**, leading to lower acceptance rates and convergence challenges.
- 🎯 **Bayesian methods enhance uncertainty quantification**, making them valuable in scenarios with scarce or noisy data.
