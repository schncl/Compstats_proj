# Bayesian Neural Networks via MCMC: A Python-Based Tutorial

## References
This work is based on: **Rohitash Chandra & Joshua Simmons**, *Bayesian Neural Networks via MCMC: A Python-based Tutorial*, IEEE, 2016.

## Overview
This repository provides a **Python-based tutorial** on Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) using **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling**. The project explores the challenges of MCMC in large models and compares BNNs with Bayesian Linear Models (BLMs) on different datasets, as well as evaluating their performance against a standard neural network (NN).

## Goals
- Provide a practical introduction to **Bayesian Neural Networks** and **MCMC sampling**.
-  Investigate the **computational challenges** and **convergence diagnostics**.
-  Compare the **performance of BNNs and NNs**.
-  Compare the **performance of BNNs and BLMs** on different datasets.

## Key Results
-  **BNNs offer greater flexibility** in high-dimensional tasks but come at a higher computational cost.
-  **BLMs perform better on small datasets**, showing faster convergence and higher efficiency.
-  **BNNs struggle with posterior multimodality**, leading to lower acceptance rates and convergence challenges.
-  **Bayesian methods enhance uncertainty quantification**, making them valuable in scenarios with scarce or noisy data.
