# Bayesian Methods in Computational Statistics

This repository explores **Bayesian Linear Models (BLMs)** and **Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)**, focusing on their performance under different dataset sizes and conditions. It includes critical analyses, results from simulations, and Python-based implementation tutorials for **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** methods.

## Overview

Bayesian methods offer a probabilistic framework for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification, treating parameters as distributions rather than fixed values. This is particularly valuable in fields such as machine learning, econometrics, and data analysis where uncertainty must be rigorously quantified.

## Key Features

- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Both BLMs and BNNs excel at incorporating model uncertainty, making predictions more robust to sparse or noisy data.
- **Regularization via Priors:** Prior knowledge can be incorporated to prevent overfitting, especially in small-sample settings.
- **Flexibility and Applicability:**
  - BLMs are suited for linear relationships and interpretable insights.
  - BNNs adapt Bayesian methods to deep learning, suitable for tasks requiring complex feature extraction (e.g., image or speech recognition).
- **Implementation:** Python-based tutorials showcase MCMC methods, including:
  - Metropolis-Hastings
  - Hamiltonian Monte Carlo  
  Examples cover linear regression and neural networks.

## Findings

### Bayesian Linear Models (BLMs)

**Strengths:**
- Consistently outperform BNNs on small datasets.
- Better convergence diagnostics due to unimodal posterior distributions.
- High interpretability with credible intervals.

**Challenges:**
- Computational overhead in high-dimensional settings.

### Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)

**Strengths:**
- Extend Bayesian principles to complex models with multi-layer architectures.
- Quantify uncertainty in deep learning tasks.

**Challenges:**
- Struggle with multi-modal posterior distributions.
- High computational cost, especially for large architectures.

### Comparison: BLMs vs. BNNs

- **Small Datasets:** BLMs outperform BNNs due to better generalization and stability.
- **High-Dimensional Tasks:** BNNs provide the necessary flexibility, albeit at a computational cost.
